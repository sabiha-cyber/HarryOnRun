#### Description:
<p>
  From my childhood, I have always been fascinated by the idea of building my own game. As someone who grew up playing video games and marveling at their technical intricacies, completing this project has been a dream come true. This game draws inspiration from the nostalgic Harry Potter series of my childhood. My admiration for the series was rekindled when my favorite teacher, David Malan, used examples from the books to bring Python programming to life. This, in turn, inspired me to create my own Harry Potter-themed game.
</p>

#### Graphics:
<p>
The game's graphics and visuals were heavily influenced by the Harry Potter series. I used AI tools to generate visuals for key elements, including Harry (the protagonist), Voldemort (the main villain), and owls (a pivotal symbol of the series). Players can also collect the iconic Golden Snitch, fulfilling a childhood fantasy of mine. The game’s background was sourced from Freepik’s resources to add an immersive feel to the experience.

#### Audio:
<p>
  The primary audio track in the game is Hedwig's Theme, which enhances the nostalgic connection to the series. Additional sound effects, such as for jumping and collecting snitches, add depth and liveliness to the gameplay.

#### Manual:
<p>
 The rules are simple:
  + Harry, the main character, must outrun Voldemort and dodge flying owls.
  - Along the way, players can collect Golden Snitches scattered across different levels.
</p>

#### Features:
<p>
  In addition to the core game mechanics, I’ve added several features to improve the overall user experience:
  + <strong>Mute Option: </strong>sPlayers can toggle the background music on or off, with visual indicators for the current state.
  * <strong>Leaderboard:</strong> The game records and displays the top five scores along with the players' names. To achieve this, I implemented a name input feature at the beginning of the game using the pygame_textinput library.
  * <strong>Navigation Controls:</strong> A back button allows seamless navigation between screens. This was implemented using a separate Button class in a button.py file.
While I primarily relied on functions for the project, I used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts sparingly, mainly for features like the button class. Although incorporating more OOP would have improved the design, my limited knowledge and the simplicity of the game led me to stick with functional programming for most parts.
</p>

#### Challenges and Obstacles:
<p>
  The biggest challenge I faced was my limited knowledge of the pygame library. To overcome this, I dedicated time to watching YouTube tutorials and reading documentation. Once I became more comfortable, I pushed myself to implement additional features that were initially intimidating.

There were moments when I considered leaving the project at its basic stage, but seeing the game evolve motivated me to persevere. Here are some specific challenges I encountered:

+ <strong>Thematic Consistency: </strong>Deciding whether to stick to a Harry Potter theme was tough due to the difficulty of sourcing non-copyrighted graphics.
* <strong>Leaderboard Functionality:</strong> Implementing user input and managing the leaderboard with JSON files required learning additional concepts beyond what I knew from CS50P. Debugging these elements was particularly challenging.
- <strong>Large Codebase:</strong> Writing, executing, and debugging a project of this scale was a new and overwhelming experience for me.
Despite these hurdles, the process of building the game was incredibly rewarding and a significant learning experience.
</p>

#### Ending thoughts:
<p>
  <strong>HarryOnRun </strong> is my first-ever project and a major milestone in my programming journey. As a beginner, this project taught me valuable lessons, from planning and feature implementation to learning new tools and overcoming challenges. The journey of bringing this game to life has been both challenging and fulfilling, and it has solidified my passion for game development and programming.
